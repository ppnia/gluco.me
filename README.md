## MyAlligatorFace

`MyAlligatorFace` was developed by [Zeb Girouard](http://portfolio.zebgirouard.com/) for [`alligator.io`](https://alligator.io).

Setup instructions are available in the accompanying [tutorial](https://alligator.io/react/react-native-getting-started/react/react-native-react-navigation) on `alligator.io`.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).

Below you'll find information about performing common tasks. The most recent version of this guide is available [here](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app/blob/master/react-native-scripts/template/README.md).
